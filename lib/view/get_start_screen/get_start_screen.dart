// The code you provided is for the GetStartScreen widget, which is a stateful widget in Flutter. Let's go through the code and explain it in detail:
//
// The GetStartScreen widget extends the StatefulWidget class, indicating that it has mutable state.
// The _GetStartScreenState class is the associated state class for the GetStartScreen widget. It extends the State class and overrides the build method, which is responsible for creating the widget's UI.
// In the build method, the MediaQuery class is used to obtain the width of the device's screen.
// The SafeArea widget ensures that the content is displayed within the safe area of the device, avoiding any notches or system UI elements.
// The Scaffold widget is a container for the app's layout structure and provides functionality like app bars, floating action buttons, etc.
// The floatingActionButton property of the Scaffold widget defines a floating action button that triggers a navigation to the TradeYourBooksScreen when pressed. The animation for the navigation is achieved using the CircularClipRoute package.
// The body property of the Scaffold widget contains the main content of the screen.
// The Container widget serves as the background of the screen. It has a semi-transparent color using the appThemeColor variable from the constant.dart file and padding specified.
// Inside the Container, a Column widget is used to arrange the child widgets vertically with equal spacing.
// The Image.asset widget displays an image loaded from the Assets.imgTrade asset. The scale property is set to 4, indicating that the image should be scaled by a factor of 4.
// The Text widget displays the "Welcome To Book Bank" text in the center. It has a custom style defined with white color, bold font weight, and font size calculated based on the screen width.
// The second Text widget displays a welcome message for the app, explaining its purpose. It has a white color and is centered.
// The final SizedBox widget adds some empty space at the bottom of the screen.
// Overall, the code sets up a screen with a background color, an image, and some text to welcome users to the Book Bank app. It also includes a floating action button that triggers navigation to the TradeYourBooksScreen when pressed.
